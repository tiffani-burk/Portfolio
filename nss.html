        <p> My role was to do the user research and design of this mobile app.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          My approach was to create a simplistic application that does one thing… really well. Sends and receives money.
          It didn’t need a ton of bells and whistles, so my goal was to keep it straight and to the point.

          <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;"> Rhino Splits is a fictitious

            While at Nashville Software School, I was tasked with creating a mobile app that would make it easy for
            young adults to do peer-to-peer financial transfers.
            Below I have detailed my design process and included a clickable prototype.

        Since there was already an existing field of "digital wallets" on the market, I was able to analyze existing
        information about Venmo, Google Pay, Cash App, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. While studying their apps, I compared
        their strength and weakness and was able to define areas of opportunity, where our app could supersede theirs.

      <h3>User Interviews</h3>
      <br>

      <p>
        The user interviews may be my favorite part of the research process! I started my interviews with a friendly
        greeting, to make sure the interviewee is at ease and a disclaimer to let them know they are being recorded.
        Recording the sessions allows me to be more present and engaged in the conversation with user, rather than
        having break eye contact to write in a notepad.
        I started all my interviews with asking about the user's background. I slowly let the conversation turn to
        technology and their past and current experiences with digital wallets. My main goal when it comes to user
        interviews is to pull stories and experiences out of the user by making them feel comfortable, as if we are just
        having a casual conversation.

          While there were quite a few emerging themes amongst the interviewees, there were three key insights I
          discovered. 1. The user is very private about their money 2. The user does not like wasting time and 3. The
          user prefers speed over security.
          These users want things fast, easy and with little bells and whistles. They want a meat and potatoes app to
          send and receive money. So that was my goal, to design a simplistic, to-the-point, digital wallet.

          When asking the client what would define success for her, she said that would be when the app was so
          successful that "Rhino Splits" would be used interchangably as a verb. While coming out with this app later in
          the game, the success would not be coming from some of the eary adopters that jumped on the Venmo bandwagon,
          but the late adopters that are fed up with their limeted digital wallet options.

        After doing in-depth interviews with the users, I found that the best way to do that would be to get rid of all
        the "extras" that they were dealing with with other similar apps.
        I also made the change of moving the navigation from the top, where I had it in the wireframe, to the bottom,
        where it is more easily accessible to the user's thumb.

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Lessons Learned</h3>

      <p style="text-align:justify; margin-top: 4px;">
        I ran two batches of user's tests. The first test was with hi-fi prototype. One key lesson I learned was to give
        the user's a scenerio-based task to complete and to explain that task before they have the phone in their hands.
        When waiting too long to explain the task, the user's would start exploring the app before understanding their
        objective.
        While the user's had a very easy time accomplishing their tasks and navigating the app, one key pain point for
        them was that they didn't recieve a defined comfirmation of their transaction being sent and, therefore, were
        unsure if they had sent it. While I had questioned this design decision, myself, my assumptions were that the
        animation I had included saying that the money sent would be indiciative enough of the confirmation. With this
        discovery, I redeisgned the animation and adding a confirmation screen, making it very clear that their
        trasaction had been completed.
        I ran my second batch of user tests with the resign and found that this was much more successful at maintaining
        the user's trust that the app was working properly. Give more time, I would have liked to run an A/B test,
        comparing the navigation at the bottom to the navigation at the top, where it previously was, but due to
        constraints that wasn't able to happen this time.
