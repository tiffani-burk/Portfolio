#### Hello! This project is for my UX portfolio, which I am currently working on at Nashville Software School. 

#### I incorporate HTML & CSS tools I've learned from Nashville Software School's UX/UI Digital Product Design course taught by Susan Culkin and Dani Crosby.  

#### In the V2 build, I hope to incorporate .... Please enjoy!
