<!-- Make this intro paragraph your own. Give it lots of detail and specify your intentions and goals for future (V1, V2 additions) -->
#### Hello! This is my portfio, containing all my UX design projects. It is still in the coding process. 

#### I incorporate HTML & CSS tools I've learned from Nashville Software School's UX/UI Digital Product Design course taught by Susan Culkin and Dani Crosby.  

#### In the V2 build, I hope to incorporate responsive coding.
